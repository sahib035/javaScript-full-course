// Chapter-3 Variable for number

// we can also store a number in a variable like 
// const mySalary = 300+"$";  //we used a $sign in "" because a $ is a datatype 
// console.log(mySalary);

//a variable can used to calculate its own value

// let marks = 70;
//  marks = marks +20;
//  console.log(marks);

//we can add two numbers in it 

// let num1 = 2;
// let num2 = 2;
// console.log(num1 + num2);


//numbers enclose in quates

// let num1 = 1;
// let num2 = "2";
// console.log(num1 + num2); they will concatenates both because one is number and other is number

//variable number can't start with number we can used number at the center or at the end
